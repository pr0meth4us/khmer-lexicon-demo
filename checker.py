"""Official Terminology Checker — one pass over the draft, every term at once.

The three things this has to get right, and why each is not obvious:

MATCHING. A dictionary of 5,700 Khmer terms scanned naively is 5,700 passes
over the document. Aho-Corasick is one pass whose cost does not grow with the
dictionary. Both are implemented and both are timed on every request, because
the honest answer depends on size: below ~220 terms the naive loop wins (C
`in` beats a Python automaton walk) and the UI says so.

BOUNDARIES. Khmer has no spaces between words, so a dictionary match can land
inside an unrelated longer word. Two filters, in order:
  1. Grapheme clusters — a match must start and end on a UAX #29 cluster
     boundary, or the highlight would cut a syllable in half. Cheap, and always
     applied.
  2. Word boundaries from khmer-nltk's CRF tokenizer — a match must also align
     with token edges. This is what removes ប្រក sitting inside ប្រកាស.
Cluster boundaries alone are NOT enough: nearly every spurious match begins and
ends on one. That was measured on the lexicon, not assumed.

OVERLAP. Longest match wins at each position, so ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាធម្មនុញ្ញ is
reported once rather than as three nested terms.
